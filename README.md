# Player_Dashboard

Test: Create a (simplified) dashboard that a player would use to view their account and focus on the ability to see stats on their gameplay. (Not authentication.)

Make no assumptions about the length, or type, of content used but feel free to be creative. Do not make use of any 3rd party services or libraries. Code should be readable, clean, and commented on.

Feel free to make fake/pseudo models for any objects.

The focus is on user management, not specifically game related, Tailwind is acceptable.

We use Entity Framework to communicate with our DB.
